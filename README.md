Jukebox is a song manager for Geometry Dash made with the goal of simplifying the process of swapping Newgrounds (or music library) songs with any NONGs.

## What is a NONG, anyway?

NONG stands for **Not On NewGrounds**. Basically, it means any song that is not on Newgrounds / the music library that was replaced manually through the game files. 

NONGs have always been a hassle to manage, because some level creators use popular Newgrounds song IDs and replace them with a NONG. So you have to swap those song files around quite a bit if you play a level with the Newgrounds song and a level with a NONG song.

## Start your jukebox!

Jukebox makes the process of managing your songs a breeze. You can download your NONGs using your method of choice. My recommandations are: [Cobalt](https://cobalt.tools/) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), a CLI application. After getting your MP3 file, you can enter a song and author name, for easier management.

> Note that Jukebox copies imported MP3 files in the storage location designated by Geode. You can open this folder from ingame.

Alternatively, you can download songs **ingame** from configurable sources, known as indexes. Jukebox provides the **Song File Hub** index as a base, which is a database of NONGs made specifically for Geometry Dash. Ideally, you should be able to get most of the songs you need from here :) 

> You can add your own indexes if you want, more documentation on this will be provided soon!

## So, how do I begin?

You can open up the Jukebox menu from any level page. Just click on the song name, and either a song list (if the level has multiple songs), or the song management screen (if the level only uses 1 song) will open. From here, you can add, remove, download and swap songs.
